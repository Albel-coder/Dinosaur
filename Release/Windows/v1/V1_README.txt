versions 1.0 and 1.1 are the first attempt to implement the demo component of the application. 
Dinosaur 1.0 does not have sophisticated graphics and realistic character physics. 
Dinosaur 1.1 adds a pixel character similar to a Google dinosaur, the obstacles are now cacti, and the character has the ability to jump.
